# Gesture-Controlled Angry Birds ðŸŽ¯  
_Control Angry Birds 2 with just your hand using Python & Computer Vision._

---

## **Overview**
Remember **Angry Birds 2**? Growing up, it was one of my favorite games.  
Now, Iâ€™ve combined it with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe** to create a **gesture-controlled version** â€”  
**Fist** to pull the slingshot, **open hand** to release.  

This project is a fun blend of **childhood nostalgia** and **modern AI-powered interaction**.

---

## **Features**
- **Hand Gesture Recognition** â€“ Detects fist & open palm in real-time.  
- **Mouse Emulation** â€“ Moves the in-game cursor using your hand.  
- **Always-on-Top Preview** â€“ See your camera feed even while playing in fullscreen.  
- **Smooth Movement** â€“ Filtered hand tracking for precise control.  

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python** â€“ Core language  
- **OpenCV** â€“ Webcam input & image processing  
- **MediaPipe Hands** â€“ 21-point hand landmark detection  
- **PyAutoGUI** â€“ Mouse control (move, click, release)  
- **Win32 API** â€“ Keep camera preview window always on top  
- **Virtual Environment (venv)** â€“ Isolated Python environment

## **How It Works**
1. **OpenCV** captures webcam feed.  
2. **MediaPipe** detects hand landmarks (21 points).  
3. **Gesture logic** determines:
   - **Fist** â†’ Pull slingshot (mouseDown).  
   - **Open palm** â†’ Release (mouseUp).  
4. **PyAutoGUI** moves the system mouse based on hand position.  
5. **Win32 API** keeps the camera feed window floating on top of Angry Birds.
